I am planning to visit paris from 1st June to 15th June. My budget for the entire trip is approximately between 10000 USD to 12000 USD. Eiffel Tower and Montmartre are my must visit locations but I would like to visit other famous locations and hidden gems too. I would like to stay in a resort and also, I would prefer to travel by renting a car.
