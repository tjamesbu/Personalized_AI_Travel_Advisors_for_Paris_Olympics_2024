#Language and Communication
Many Parisians understand and speak at least basic English, especially in popular tourist areas and the hospitality industry.
However, making an effort to use basic French greetings like "bonjour", "s'il vous pla√Æt", and "merci" is appreciated and can improve interactions.
Parisians may be hesitant to speak English initially out of pride in their language and desire to not appear imperfect.
Writing requests down can sometimes be more successful than speaking for those with difficulties in French pronunciation.
#Safety and Scams
Common scams around tourist areas include people trying to distract you, fake petitions, illegal street vendors selling counterfeit goods, and solicitors for overpriced clubs/cabarets.
Pickpocketing is a risk, especially in crowded areas like public transport, tourist sites, and cafes.
Handling cash openly, using ATMs outside of banks, and paying with cards when possible can reduce targeting.
Unlicensed taxis/private vehicles soliciting customers should be avoided.
#Local Laws and Customs
Laws restrict activities like public alcohol/drug use, certain photography locations, and purchasing counterfeit goods.
Customs to observe include removing shoes indoors, dressing modestly at religious sites, and being mindful of noise levels, especially at night.
Complaints about "night noise" are restricted by local laws protecting nightlife in Paris.
Licensed taxis should be used instead of unlicensed private vehicles.
