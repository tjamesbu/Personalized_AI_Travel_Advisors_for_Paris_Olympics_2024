From restaurants to bars to hotels, I hope you’ll find a few new favourites that will capture your heart too.\\xa0 Far away from the tourist traps, these ideas will help you see Paris through the eyes of a local!\\nRalph Lauren Restaurant\\nBehind some imposing doors on the Boulevard St Germain is the most beautiful courtyard restaurant.\\xa0 I found this place by doing quite a bit of research online because from the street you don’t really know it’s there.\\xa0 The food is quite American themed – think Burgers, Lobster and Cobb Salad but it’s the setting that is just so beautiful.\\xa0 Whether for lunch in the sun or a romantic candlelit dinner it’s just such a stunning location.\\xa0 And you’d never know you were just 10 paces from one of the busiest streets in Paris.\\xa0 A relaxed dining experience in the centre of Paris that feels like you’re worlds away from reality!\\nRestaurant L’Île\\nJust out to the west of Paris is a small island in the Seine called Île St Germain.\\xa0 Most Parisians have never even heard of the island, let alone the restaurant, so it really is one of the definitive Hidden Gems in Paris.\\xa0 The whole island is parkland and in the middle there is a restaurant set in stunning gardens.\\xa0 L’île is absolutely beautiful and best visited on a sunny day when you can eat outside on the terrace under the gorgeous cherry blossoms.\\xa0 The food is chic brasserie style with salads, steaks, seafood and fantastic ingredients.\\xa0 I’ve had the goats cheese millefeuille as a starter and also the tuna tartare and the freshness of the produce is fantastic.\\xa0 Good simple food done really well in a beautiful setting – what more could you ask for?\\nBagatelle Restaurant\\nIf you fancy taking a wander through the Bois de Boulogne on a sunny day then don’t miss this amazing restaurant.\\xa0 Set in the rose gardens on the far west side of the Park, you’d be hard pushed to find somewhere more hidden away.\\xa0 With an incredible terrace area for dining outside and a light bright dining room if you prefer to eat indoors, this place is definitely one of Hidden Gems in Paris.\\xa0 The menu is light and elegant, with plenty of salads and seafood.\\xa0\\xa0 Exactly what you want for a light lunch, outside, with a crisp glass of white wine.\\xa0 You can also rent the entire place out and I think it would be a beautiful setting for private events or even a wedding reception.\\nPavillon de la Reine\\nMy favourite of all the Hidden Gems in Paris has to be the Pavillon de la Reine.\\xa0 While exploring Places des Vosges one day I saw a very discreet sign on the wall saying Pavillion de la Reine.\\xa0 Wandering through the huge doors I found myself in an oasis, far from the hustle and bustle of the main square.\\xa0 The Pavillion de la Reine is a Spa Hotel set just back from the Place des Vosges and while I’ve never stayed there, what I love so much about it is the beautiful courtyard.\\xa0 You can sit in the sun and relax with a glass of wine and never know that you are in the centre of Paris.\\nThe courtyard itself is beautiful, very green, with ivy climbing the walls and lots of modern art sculptures from the gallery next door.\\xa0 I’ve sat here for many an afternoon taking a quick respite from the business of the streets.\\xa0 The staff are very friendly and the bar is an honesty bar so you help yourself to wine/champagne and pay for what you had at reception at the end.\\xa0 It really is a small haven of tranquility in a bustling city and you leave feeling relaxed and re-charged!\\xa0 I’m sure it would be amazing to stay there too but it seems pretty pricey!\\nWe just go there for the wine, the peace and the sunshine.\\xa0 It’s definitely a favourite spot for both me and my mum!\\nHotel des Grandes Ecoles\\nI used to live at the other end of the street to this hotel and never thought much of it until one day when they left the main door open and i could see all the way through into the stunning courtyard at the back.\\xa0 I’ve never stayed her so I can’t vouch for the rooms and service – I’m just so enthralled by the terrace and courtyard area that I can’t wait to stay one day.\\nI can just imagine, breakfast, with the newspapers in a sunny spot – heaven!\\xa0 They used to only let you book three months in advance – no earlier, so we never managed to get a room as they all filled up so fast.\\xa0 Recently they’ve changed their booking system so you can now book up to 9 months in advances so here’s hoping that next time I go to Paris I can get in!\\nCiel de Paris\\nThis bar is not so much one of the Hidden Gems in Paris, as it was an impossibility to find.\\xa0 Situated at the top of the Tour Montparnasse I think it has the best view in all of Paris.\\xa0 Most people trek up the Eiffel Tower to get a bird’s-eye view of Paris but from the tour Montparnasse you can get the same view with the Eiffel Tower included in it!\\nI’d done some research so I knew it was up there, but when we got the tower there were no signs, no directions, we thought we’d got it wrong.\\xa0 Finally we asked someone who explained you had to go to a special door round the side and take the lift to the top – you’d never know what to do unless you asked!\\xa0 When you arrive you step into a beautiful champagne bar with a completely unrivalled view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower.\\nAmazing during the day but even more spectacular at night when the whole of Paris is light up and the Eiffel Tower sparkles.\\xa0 Definitely the best view in town!\\nLe Troubadour\\nWhen all the tourists head to the crush of the Artist’s Square in Montmartre to grab a drink, you can act all smug as you venture one street further to find this tucked away courtyard cocktail bar.\\xa0 Bathed in sunlight you can enjoy an afternoon drink amidst\\xa0 the cobbled stones and lush vegetation.\\xa0 The cocktails are fantastic, the vibe is very chilled and it’s very easy to lose time here and realise you’ve spent an entire afternoon sitting in the sun and sampling cocktails.\\nLibrary Bar at the St James Hotel\\nIf old school glamour is what you’re looking for then you need to head to the 16th arrondissement where you’ll find the luxury St James Hotel.\\xa0 A beautiful Parisian Mansion that is definitely one of the Hidden Gems in Paris.\\xa0 \\nA luxury boutique hotel and private members club that is way out of my budget for a night’s stay, but i can afford a drink in their beautiful library bar.\\xa0 A martini in here is the perfect aperitif to any night out in Paris and the relaxed environment is charming and luxurious at the same time.\\nSo there you have it – all of my favourite Hidden Gems in Paris – I’ve done the hard work for you – now all you have to do is go and enjoy them!\\xa0 If you love finding different places you should check out my Top Restaurants in the Algarve post or my post on the\\xa0 Most Authentic & Traditional Restaurants in Madrid.\\nPin Hidden Gems in Paris for later\\nLike this:Like Loading...\\nRelated Posts\\nLa Cabane des Praz – Les Praz de Chamonix, Chamonix, France\\nThe Swan Hotel Newby Bridge,

We’ve been to Paris over a dozen times & love discovering the off the beaten track things to do, restaurants, etc. 💎 Here our top hidden gems of Paris for things to do in the city & where you can have more of an authentic Parisian experience. \\nCanal Saint-Martin is a wonderful hidden gem in Paris. Photo by Vince Duque on Unsplash\\n1. Canal Saint-Martin: One of the Hidden Gems of Paris for a Romantic EveningCanal Saint-Martin feels like how Paris used to be, or at least how it’s portrayed in movies or books. It’s a lovely canal in the northeast side of the city (in the 10th arrondissement near République) where you can sit along the water, grab a baguette, some cheese, and bottle of wine, and have a romantic picnic either in the daytime, or even better, at night. It’s a place where many locals go, so it feels like a real Parisian experience. Some people (mainly tourists) picnic along the Seine, but the Canal Saint-Martin is the Paris hidden gem. 👉🏼 One AWESOME thing to do here is this food tour below, the “No Diet Tour.” It’s focused on hidden gem restaurants in the area, and the food is fantastic. \\n👉🏼 Another cool way to see the Canal is via this street art tour (it’s only 90 minutes). There is a lot of fascinating street art around Canal Saint-Martin, and this is a great way of seeing it. 🔥 Hot tip: Combine this with a cocktail at Le Comptoir Générale (see below), a 5 minute walk away. 🚇 Getting there: 5 minute walk from Metro République (Metro lines 3, 5, 8, 9 and 11). \\nGetting €10 tickets to the opera is a wonderful hidden gem Paris experience. Photo by Gwen King on Unsplash. \\n2. Opéra Garnier: Experience of a Lifetime for €10. Bucket list Paris! The National Opera of Paris’ central opera house, Palais Garnier, is virtually a world wonder, and you can see a performance there affordably. This is one of our favorite things to do in Paris. The hall and foyer resemble a Versailles-like palace inside with lots of gold, beautiful paintings (including the ceiling by Marc Chagall), rococo decorations. And being the Paris opera, the ballet and opera performances are world class. Save it for your Paris bucket list.\\n🔥 Hot tip: The best kept secret of the opera is that they offer last-minute tickets for almost free! (ok, 10 euros). The tickets open up 2 hours before the performance at the side entrance, so you just have to stand in line then, get your tickets, and come back for the opera time. They’re “partially obstructed view,” so you may have to lean over to see, but you still get to experience the Paris opera! We’ve done it several times, and it’s fantastic. 👉🏼 If you don’t want to stand in line 2 hours ahead of time, you can also get discount opera tickets here. 🥂 Treat yourself and get a coupe of champagne in the intermission for the full experience. 🔥 Hot tip 2: If you’re under 28 or over 65, the opera offers discounted non-obstructed view tickets for €35 for a ticket to an opera, €25 for a ticket to a ballet or concert/recital, or €10 for a ticket to a Sunday chamber music concert.\\xa0🚇 Getting there: 3 minute walk from the Metro Opéra (lines 3, 7, and 8). \\nGet Discount Tickets to the Paris Opera \\n👉🏼 Note — Paris also has a modern opera house in a different area of the city, the Bastille Opera, which offers a much more modern experience. \\n3. Angelina’s: To-die-for Hot Chocolate close to the Louvre\\nOne of the best cups of hot cocoa you’ll ever have — and drink it in a James Bond-like setting — is at Angelina’s cafe near the Louvre museum. Angelina’s has been around for 120 years, and it makes the most famous of the hot chocolate cafés in Paris.☕ It’s a classy, old school café, and it’s a lovely afternoon experience just sipping on the hot chocolate and having a piece of cake. It’s also a nice break if you’re visiting the Louvre or nearby tourist attractions of central Paris. 👉🏼 Speaking of which, here’s a great way to skip the lines at the museums nearby, including the Louvre. 🔥 Hot tip: It can get crowded, so try to go early to avoid long lines/queues.\\n🍫 If you’re craving for more chocolate (who isn’t?): Take this guided “chocolate walk” that has stops for all kinds of chocolate & pastry everything: truffles, cocoa, eclairs, bon bons... It’s a good one I recommend if you’re a chocolate lover. \\n🚇 Getting there: 2 minute walk from Metro Tuileries (line 1), or a 9 minute walk from the Louvre Museum. \\n4. Rodin Museum: Wonderful Boutique Museum where the Artist Lived\\nWhile 90% of tourists flock to the Louvre and the Musee d’Orsay, the Auguste Rodin Museum is one of the hidden gems of Paris that doesn’t have the huge crowds. You can see the famous Thinker, as well as some of his other most famous sculptures, including The Burghers of Calais, The Gates of Hell, and Balzac, and dozens of other of his gorgeous works. 🌳 It also has a really lovely outdoor rose garden and area to walk around, which feels like a breath of fresh air in central Paris.The museum is in an 18th century mansion, so it feels like walking through a château rather than a modern museum. \\n🔥 Hot tip: Skip the lines and get your tickets online. You can also combine museum tickets in the area. Rodin actually lived there when it was a hotel, and his old room is preserved, so that’s an interesting bit to see. The mansion was renovated in 2015 (a 16 million euro renovation). Definitely recommend. Photo by Jillian Peterson on Unsplash. 🚇 Getting there: 2 minute walk from Metro Varennes (Lines ) or 20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. \\n5. The Marais: Take a Stroll in this Charming Area\\nThe Marais on the right back of the Seine is a wonderful area to walk around for hours and hours and window shop, sip champagne, have a cappuccino, etc. To be fair, the Marais isn’t that hidden, but it’s a great bucket list Paris area that is definitely not the Louvre or Eiffel Tower, and tons of locals go and hang out there as well. There are so many excellent restaurants, bars, small boutiques of all kinds, historic places, and more in the Marais. It’s also the old Jewish quarter and LGBTQ+ area of the city. There’s also a really good gourmet food & walking tour of the Marais that we recommend, where you get 2 tastings & learn from a really good guide. Top things to do in the Marais:Walk the winding streets: Arguably the best thing to do in the Marais is simply wander around the narrow, winding streets and discover the half timbered houses, the carved masks above the doors, etc. It’s charming—and free! \\n🎨 Visit the Picasso Museum: This world class museum is dedicated to artist Pablo Picasso, who lived most of his life in Paris. It has 5,000 of his works, including Man with Guitar.Have a picnic at Place des Vosges: Grab a baguette and a bottle of champagne and head over to this classical, elegant square from 1605 that has a wonderful garden to relax and enjoy the beautiful Parisian buildings, trees, and people watching.👉🏼 Don’t miss the cobblestone Rue des Barres, which dates from medieval times & has particularly old houses.🌳 Stroll through the National Archives garden: The Hôtel de Soubise garden inside its courtyard is open and lovely to walk through.☕️ Have a cappuccino: Good espresso drinks used to be hard to find in Paris, but no longer, thankfully. Our top pick for good coffee in the Marais is Le Peloton.🚇 Getting there: There are several Metro stops in the Marais, including Saint-Paul (line 1), Hôtel de Ville (line 1), and Rambuteau (line 11). \\nThe Palais Royal is a hidden gem in Paris & a romantic spot. Photo by Gloria Villa on Unsplash\\n6. Palais Royal: The “most romantic” place in Paris The Palais Royal, dubbed Paris’ most romantic spot by several Parisians we spoke to, is one of the lovely hidden gems of Paris that’s just a stone’s throw from the Louvre Museum and Tuileries Garden. So if you want a break from sightseeing in that area, check out the Palais. It’s a 17th century palace with a beautiful garden lined with chestnut and linden trees. It was originally the residence of Cardinal Richelieu and today exudes tranquility among the trees and beautiful architecture and romantic seats all around. 🔥 Hot tip: Combine a trip here with a hot chocolate at Angelina’s (see above). 🔥 Hot tip 2: The famed striped Buren Columns on the south end of the park are great for photo opps. 🚇 Getting there: 4 minute walk from Metro Palais Royal/Musée du Louvre (lines 1 and 7) or 7 minute walk from Metro Tuileries (line 1) or or a 6 minute walk from the Louvre Museum.\\n7. Berthillon: Some of the world’s best ice cream, in the oldest part of Paris\\nIf you’re strolling around or near the Île de la Cité in central Paris, go and stop for an ice cream at Berthillon. It’s been around since 1954, and for a reason.This Paris hidden gem is some of the best ice cream we’ve ever had anywhere, and we go back every time we’re in Paris. They’re famous for reportedly using only high quality ingredients, and their sorbet is a secret recipe. Photo by Stephan Valentin. Explore the oldest part of Paris: Berthillon is also a lovely way to enjoy walking around the area where the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral is located, explore the often sleepy Île de la Cité, the oldest part of Paris, and enjoy the Seine River. 🔥 Hot tip: This is just behind the Notre Dame cathedral (an 8 min walk), so it’s a great stop after seeing it, and also on the banks of the Seine River. \\n🚇 Getting there: On the Île de la Cité and a 3 minute walk from the Pont-Marie Metro (line 7). \\nLe Comptoir Generale is a hidden gem of Paris & is great for cocktails or brunch. Photo: Le Comptoir Generale. \\n8. Le Comptoir: Paris Hidden Gem to Have Cocktails or Brunch, Where Parisians GoLe Comptoir Générale is a unique, large cocktail bar and brunch spot with an Afro-Caribbean feel that is very popular with Parisians and off the beaten path for tourists. On-point Mojitos, plants everywhere, relaxed atmosphere, rum punch, everything a bit unique but very hip and happening. Brunch is a hit here, and they do dinner as well, which is quite good according to locals. For other secrets to good eating in Paris, check out this blog from our friends at Travel Bliss Now. Like the Canal Saint-Martin (and only 5 min walk away), it’s in the 10th arrondissement near the Metro République, so you can spend your whole evening around this area. Or multiple evenings, like we like to do. 🔥 Hot tip: Have an delectable dinner nearby at Michelin-rated Restaurant Elmer. It’s pricey but a dining experience you won’t forget. 🚇 Getting there: 10 minute walk from the Metro République (Metro lines 3, 5, 8, 9 and 11). Elmer is 13 minutes walk away from Le Comptoir.\\nThe Luxembourg Gardens on the right bank of the Seine are charming. Photo by Yusuf Ak on Unsplash\\n9. Luxembourg Gardens: Best Place for a Paris picnic The Luxembourg gardens are a fantastic part of the city, a bit like the Central Park of Paris. Bask in the sun, pick up a baguette nearby and have a picnic, watch the intense local chess games, and enjoy the fountains, ponds, and beautiful trees at this iconic Parisian place.While they aren’t that hidden, the gardens are gorgeous and huge (25 hectares), which is why tons of Parisians flock there as well. That means you can have a local experience there even with other tourists. It’s a bucket list Paris must! 🔥 Hot tip: The Luxembourg Gardens are on the left bank of the Seine, so combine a visit there with the Catacombs or Pantheon. 🍽 Dinner nearby: One of the best Paris hidden gem restaurants in the area is Lobineau in the Latin Quater, which serves outstanding French meals, specializing in seafood.🚇 Getting there: 5 minute walk from several metro stations: Rennes (line 12), Notre-Dame des Champs (line 12), or Sainte-Placide (line 4), Saint-Sulpice (line 4), or Odéon (lines 4 and 10). \\n10. Sainte-Chappelle: The Prettier Alternative to Notre Dame: Bucket List Paris\\nWhile 90% of tourists flock to Notre Dame cathedral, you’ll get a more visually gorgeous experience at Sainte-Chappelle, a former royal chapel which is just 8 minutes walk away. The gigantic, very colorful stained glass windows create a very special effect, and a bit of a spiritual experience. To be sure, Sainte-Chappelle can get crowded, but it is very beautiful and unique (speaking from someone who’s visited far too many churches across Europe). It’s bucket list Paris! Photo by Sasha Lezhnev. Also just nearby is the Conciergerie, where Queen Marie-Antoinette was imprisoned, worth a visit.🔥 Hot tip: Avoid the crowds by going right when the church opens at 9am. You’ll have a better experience for sure. Just double check the opening times on the website before you go in case of any last minute changes. \\nBuy tickets: You need a ticket to go to the cathedral, but now you can buy them online in advance to avoid the line in person. I recommend that for sure, as the lines can get long here. 🚇 Getting there: 1 minute walk from Metro Cité (line 4) or 5 minute walk from\\xa0Châtelet (lines 1,7,11, and 14). \\nJardin des Plantes is one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world. Photo by Daphné Be Frenchie on Unsplash\\n11. Le Jardin des Plantes: Very well done Botanical Gardens — of Paris’ Hidden Gems Paris’ main botanical garden, the Jardin des Plantes (garden of plants) is off the beaten track in Paris, so most people don’t think of visiting. Some have called it the best botanical gardens in the world, and others say it’s one of the most beautiful spots in Paris, and we would agree with both sentiments. This is a great hidden travel gem. 🌳 The Jardin is huge and has lots to offer: there are waterfalls, art exhibits, a variety of different climate rooms, it’s fun for the whole family, and it’s good on a rainy day as well. Plus it’s on the bank of the Seine River, so you can take a walk along the river afterwards. And it’s off the beaten path, which is wonderful to find in Paris. 🚇 Getting there: Metro Gare d’Austerlitz (line 10) or Place Monge (line 7) . OR you can get there in style by boat on the Seine — the Batobus will drop you off at the stop Jardin des Plantes just in front of the garden. \\n12. Paris Hidden Gems in Montmartre: Cocktails under the Moulin Rouge, Coffee where Picasso sipped\\nMontmartre, a famous neighborhood in the north of Paris, is home to Sacré-Coeur basilica and is an art mecca — it’s where famous artists from Edgar Degas to Henri Matisse to Toulouse-Lautrec to Pierre-Auguste Renoir in the 19th century made their home. 📷 It’s also where photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson took some of his most famous shots, and today where you can see many artists paint on the street.Two hidden gems of Paris in this iconic neighborhood, and one fascinating café: \\nBar à Bulles (pictured — photo by Floriane). This is such a cool spot. They make delicious cocktails, it’s classy, and the best part is that you can literally touch the famous Moulin Rouge club windmill as you sit on the terrace outside sipping your cosmopolitan or caipirinha. 🍽 Restaurant Chez Pitou. Once you’re done with cocktail hour, head over to Chez Pitou, a great farm-to-table restaurant that some say is their favorite dinner spot in Paris. It’s a lovely meal in an unpretentious setting, and the wine list is excellent. The owner, Monsieur Pitou, is often around and takes pride in the food, so you may be able to meet him. Best to make a reservation. ☕️ Have a coffee where Picasso or Van Gogh did. Le Consulat isn’t really hidden, but it is cool — it’s a brasserie where many famous artists used to frequent, from Picasso to Renoir to Toulouse-Lautrec even to Van Gogh. Have a coffee or a bite to eat. 🔥 Hot tip: Combine the fun evening with some of Montmartre’s daytime highlights, including climbing the hill to Sacré-Coeur, getting your portrait painted by a Parisian artist, or visiting the Musée de Montmartre, where Renoir used to live. 🚇 Getting there: Metro Abbesses (line 12) is probably the best overall stop to explore Montmartre from. \\nCherry blossoms are wonderful at the Parc de Sceaux, a Paris hidden gem. Photo by Thu Ba To on Unsplash\\n13. Parc de Sceaux: Escape the City at this Huge Paris Hidden Gem Park Another park, you say? Well, yes, but Parc de Sceaux south of the city is different. It’s very underrated and differentiates itself by its sheer size and the fact that you really feel like you get away from the city by being in nature. If you want a “day away” in nature, this is your spot. It has a forest, a series of beautiful fountains, a canal, a beautiful château, and many walking and running paths. Off the beaten track Paris! A good honorable mention here is the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in Northeast Paris, which has gorgeous gardens & a lake.🌳 The best time to go is to see the cherry blossoms in the spring. The park has a bigger concentration of cherry blossom trees than anywhere else in Paris. However, each season is special in this park, honestly. If you can’t get to Japan or Washington, DC at this time of year, this is a good alternative. 🚇 Getting there: Parc de Sceaux is in the southern outskirts of Paris, so you have to take the RER B train to get there. 10 minute walk from the RER B stop Antony. \\nThe Louis Vuitton Foundation is an amazing modern art museum & hidden gem of Paris. Photo by Barthelemy de Mazenod. \\n14. Louis Vuitton Foundation: Hidden Gem Modern Art Museum If you like modern art, the Fondation Louis Vuitton — a museum, not an outlet store for LV handbags — is phenomenal. Of course, the George Pompidou Center in central Paris has wonderful modern art exhibits as well, but it’s also crowded with long lines normally. Designed by the famous architect Frank Gehry (same designer as the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles & the Guggenheim Bilbao), the Louis Vuitton Foundation is an architectural marvel, and just walking around it makes you think and wonder, with all of its hidden corners and unique light features. 🔥 Get your tickets to the museum in advance here. It has wonderful exhibits. They currently have a Mark Rothko show going on. 🚇 Getting there: Metro Les Sablons (line 1). \\xa0Did we miss any hidden travel gems? Send in yours & get featured. \\nHi!
