This is a site built with [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/) by JP Bianchi

It can be deployed in various ways, on Reflex.dev (easiest) but also [self-hosted](https://reflex.dev/docs/hosting/self-hosting/).

For deployment on reflex.dev, simply cd to this directory and do 
`reflex init`
`reflex deploy`

The chat box has to be fixed (small charcters, action bar too long) and a logo.png must be added to 'assets'.  
And the env file must be given a proper OPENAI_API_KEY, or passed during deploy, or use another LLM.  

The current deployment is at https://paris-trip-planner.reflex.run
