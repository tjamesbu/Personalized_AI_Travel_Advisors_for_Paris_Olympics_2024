            "I'm sure there will be a lot of specifics, but I wanted to add one general tip that will make a huge difference.  The French begin EVERY interaction by saying \"Bonjour\" to each other.  It's considered very rude and abrupt not to do that.  So when you enter any kind of shop, or want to ask a waiter if you can sit at a table, or need help at a post office, or ANYTHING, begin every conversation with a very friendly \"Bonjour Madame (or Monsieur).\"  You will find everything goes so much more smoothly.   And even if you speak almost no French, make sure you have a few basic phrases, like \"Merci,\" \"S'il vous plait\" and \"S'il vous plait, parlez-vous anglais?\"   \n\nMy only other tip is please be sure to visit as many lovely boulangeries as possible, and treat yourself to a sandwich on a freshly baked crusty baguette, maybe jambon/fromage, or whatever you like, there's nothing better!   Finish up with a nice beignet and that's all you'll need for a delightful lunch.",
            "Do: say Bonjour, as the other commenter said it's basic politeness here. \n\nDon't: stand on the left side of the escalator, block a busy sidewalk, try to get in the metro before people inside were able to get off, talk louder than everyone around you.\n\nIn general remember Paris isn't just a tourist attraction, but an actual city where people live and work. Some are busy, some are in a hurry, same as everywhere else! You'll be fine :)",
            "Yay!!!! Welcome!!!\n\nMy personal favorites:\n\n\\- Going up the Tour Saint Jacques, the guided tour is in French (although I think they offer a few in English) but the VIEW from the top is the best second only to the towers of Notre Dame (RIP). It's not a very touristy activity, I've gone before when it was just me and another woman on the tour so we had extra time at the top for photos!\n\n\\- Visiting the inside of the Op\u00e9ra Garnier. I'm a fan of Phantom of the Opera and I've been here so many times and don't get tired of it. It's not a huge monument so it won't take up too much time, but there's like a miniature hall of mirrors that resembles Versailles so you can get your fix if you don't have time to visit the palace!\n\n\\- Picnic along the river. One evening be sure to buy some cheap wine, a nice baguette and some snacks or cheese and just sit along the river for sunset. You can also do this in any of the public gardens although sometimes they close early like at 8pm. But lunch in the Luxembourg Garden, Champ de Mars or Esplanade des Invalides is cool. \n\n\\- Go to Trocadero and the area by the Eiffel Tower or Montmartre EARLY in the morning! There will be almost nobody around, so you'll avoid anxiety-inducing crowds and there will be less of a rick of theft/pickpocketing. \n\nDon'ts:\n\n\\- Don't bother going up the Eiffel Tower. If you really want to, go up the Tour Montparnasse. Eiffel Tower is just not worth it. Also don't eat at any restaurants in that area as you'll get ripped off! REMEMBER: we do not tip in France, and lots of restaurants in touristy areas have started suggesting tips and even pressuring tourists to tip. Don't do it, don't encourage it!!!!!\n\n\\- If you go to Sacr\u00e9 Coeur you may be approached by some very persistent guys who will try to put a string bracelet around your wrist. This is a scam, be firm in saying NO and continue on your way. There are sadly many street scams in Paris, simply ignore anyone who tries to come up to you!",
            "And\n\nIf you break ANY of these rules, the Broken Tourist Gendarmes will haul you off to Place Concorde and put you on the guillotine.\n\nIt's a time honoured tradition.",
            "For a nice city view including the Eiffel Tower, don\u2019t go to the Montparnasse tower. Granted, you see the whole city, but it\u2019s expensive. Instead, go have coffee on the 7th floor of Printemps Haussmann. Cheaper, still a great view, and you get coffee. Or find a rooftop bar, you\u2019ll get a cocktail for the price of the elevator ticket in the Montparnasse tower.\n\nIf you plan to visit any of the \u201cmust sees\u201d book your time slot in advance. After Covid, almost all monuments and museums switched to pre bookings. You might still buy your ticket on site but not without waiting in line for hours, and sometimes the quotas are already filled.\n\nDo your touristy visits during the week, except maybe on Wednesdays when it\u2019s more common for kids outings. Some schools don\u2019t have classes on Wednesdays. (Yeah, WHY?! Doesn\u2019t make sense I know.) You\u2019ll have maybe less crowds.\n\nIf you visit the must-sees, don\u2019t stop to sign any petitions, let anyone approach you with a bracelet or force one on you, or give you a \u201cgold\u201d ring they found on the ground. They\u2019re all scams. Be rude and loud when the bracelet sellers try at Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur. (They will be rude too regardless, it\u2019s not personal, they will just try to intimidate you to pay.) Also look out for the romani girls picking pockets in groups in the metro, especially on metro line 1. \n\nThe Ladur\u00e9e restaurant on Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es has bad service and exorbitantly high prices, it\u2019s not worth it although it\u2019s cute. Haven\u2019t tried it myself but friends said it was their worst restaurant experience in Paris. Buy your macarons elsewhere, it can still be Ladur\u00e9e but pick another store. The best, fanciest patisserie I\u2019ve had was Cyril Lignac\u2019s. Expensive but heavenly!",
            "Do: I was there about three weeks ago and made a reservation at Magma. One star Michelin restaurant and it was 70\u20ac per person for a 5 course dinner.

            "If you want to say anything to anyone, and it's the first time you've spoken to them that day, make sure the first thing you say is bonjour. Or bonsoir if it's past around 6.30pm/7pm. \n\nIt's hard to describe, but the anglophone version of not saying bonjour is kind of like if the first thing you to a stranger was YO, YOU! It's weird and people will be nicer and more helpful if you say it.",
            "Stay on the right on the elevator if you're not walking. Thanks",
            "DO: Two things that a lot of folks miss: the Carnavalet (Paris History and its free!) and Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de la Nature (incredible, sometimes gorgeous, sometimes cheeky, definitely not what you would expect). Both are in the Marais and near some really good restaurants.\n\nDO: I concur with folks that say to book tickets for your must-do things ASAP. Paris is absolutely packed with tourists and you can miss out. I had a friend from US visiting me a few weeks ago. She wanted to go to Versailles and the Catacombs and neither were available. What I recommend is to book one thing per day and use the rest of the day to explore, just walk around, have a pastry or a glass of wine and relax. \n\nDO: When you have free time or just need to chill out, go to one of the many beautiful parks. Sit in the dog park that's just under Sacre C\u0153ur and enjoy the show. I make that part of every trip to Montmarte. Go on a statue hunt There are various lucky statues like Montaigne (rub his foot, plus he's by the Cluny which is very cool), Dalida (rub her breasts and you'll be lucky in love), 5 Statues of Liberty, etc etc etc That's just me! \n\nIf you are able, try to walk everywhere so that you can see more. \n\nBonne chance!",
            "Do: have a croissant! Seriously, I've eaten many and there's nothing like them in Paris.\n\nDo: walk everywhere you can - schedule some extra time to people watch, state any the architecture and stop for a cafe gourmand. \n\nDo: cross things off your bucket list - way too many people saying don't go to Eiffel, don't go to Versailles... Etc. If you've always wanted to go you will not be disappointed. \n\nDon't: wear track pants, joggers, or Lululemon type pants unless you're actually working out. While people don't dress to the 9s necessarily, you will feel super out of place in these items. \n\nDon't: take Uber everywhere - transit is awesome there, reliable and cheap. \n\nDon't: try to make perfect change when paying cash - it seems most people don't want your 20 eurocents, they'll just give you change.\n\nDon't: tip. This will be hard if you're from a tipping culture country but you'll get used to it, and you're helping France not try to start it up - enjoy the less fuckery with eating out that comes from doing so. :)",
            "Don\u2019t over schedule and rush trying to hit everything on a tourism checklist. It\u2019s better to fully enjoy a few sites than to touch-and-go on many. \nIf staying in Paris, use the metro and buses or taxis instead of renting a car. Parking and driving are very time consuming.",

Here it goes:\n\nI currently have 3 tickets to the Taylor Swift concert on May 12th.  I live in the United States but am considering a trip with my wife and daughter, based around this concert.  These tickets are all through Stubhub.  Typically in the US the way this would work is that the original ticket owner will get access to the digital tickets via Ticketmaster sometime shortly before the concert and then click on the \"transfer\" ticket on their end and put in the email of the buyer (me in this case) and the tickets would then show up on my Ticketmaster app with a bar code to scan.  They don't check ID vs a name on the ticket or anything like that.\n\nThe reason I wanted to come here and ask is because it's very unclear what France, and specifically Paris allows and does not allow.  I keep reading things about Lyon and about the UK and Germany and people outside of Europe seem to tend to lump everything into one basket.  Things like \"it's illegal\" and \"they won't let you in if your name doesn't match the ticket\" etc.  \n\nWe've been to Paris twice before and it is our favorite city in the world to visit, but I probably will not book this trip if it's a situation where we can't go to the show.

Paris is more kid-friendly than we originally expected. \n\nChills spots - Luxembourg Gardens is a great place to bring kids. We stayed in St Germain area for our hotel. Safe, generally kid friendly. Several bookstores to check out. \n\nPublic transportation- used bus and Uber primarily. Actually did not use the metro at all. Easier to roll up the stroller on the bus ramp. \n\nStrollers - generally stroller friendly although cannot comment on access to metro as we did not use it. We brought a small foldable overhead compartment compatible stroller but this would not have tolerated the many cobblestone bumpy pathways we encountered. Fortunately we had also rented a heavier duty stroller that was delivered to our hotel and this worked well. \n\nOther - although your children may not actively recall the trip, the experience of flying long distance (assuming you\u2019re outside of Europe), recovering from jet lag, encountering a different culture/language passively cultivates the behavior of children, hardens and prepares them for future trips. \n\nRecommend a photo shoot with your family. The Parisian Photographers is the one we used. Paid $250 for hour long session with 2 different settings with Eiffel Tower in background. Lifetime memories and something to show the kids when they\u2019re older. \n\nIf you have time for a day trip, check out Giverny Gardens."

This might be a good alternative if you don't have time to go to the effiel tower.\"\n\nOr, go to the Tour Montparnasse. 19 Euros, and you get one of the best Eiffel Tower view. Also, it's not so crowded because it's not a well known attraction.",

            " About your 4th statement, I would rather advise you to get a Navigo Easy Pass with a \u00ab\u00a0WEEK PACKAGE (forfait semaine in French.)\u00a0\u00bb. It is much more cost-effective.\n\nBe careful to take zones 1-5 which allows you to go OUTSIDE of Paris (eg.: Versailles, Disneyland, bus shuttle to CDG airport) for 30\u20ac. You get unlimited access on public transportation and is much more cheaper than buying 10-20 tickets. (The 10 ticket bundle is 17\u20ac)\n\nEDIT : the coms are right : get the decouverte and not the navigo easy. That way you can buy the weekly pass ! thanks for the correction guys !",
            "The whole bedbug thing was blown out of proportion- they exist just like they do in any city on earth. You probably don\u2019t need to worry about them. I just spent two weeks in Paris and no one there gives a crap about bedbugs",

            ">Bed bugs in Paris do exist. I was on the metro and saw them actively crawling on a person jacket. I did not sit on the metro even when it was empty. Furthermore, my partner and I checked each other when we got of the subway for any thing stuck to us. I also checked the hotel rooms after checked in. No need to panic about bed bugs, but it's good to be aware where you are sitting/sleeping.\n\nI question if these were actual bedbugs. Bedbugs are very small and dislike the light. I've had them before in my apartment, as well as dealt with them in multiple hostels, and I rarely saw them. They come out at night, and then disappear. The only time I managed to see them in person is when I woke up with them on me (as I'm quite allergic and my body goes into an adrenaline rush when I'm bit, which sucks as they love me).\n\nYou would have to be right next to the person in order to see them, and I really really doubt they would come out on a brightly lit train.\n\nMoreover, when I was in Paris last week, I did see some other bugs on the subway. These bugs were definitely not bedbugs.\n\nObviously I might be wrong, but based on my experiences, I would be shocked to see them actively walking around on anyone.",

I still haven\u2019t seen everything I want to see in Paris. I don\u2019t think I ever will. Not because of the size of paris, because it\u2019s super easy to get around, but because there is so much to see, and so much you want to see more than once.",
            "Place d\u2019Italie China Town itself is a nice little thing to look especially during Lunar New Year. The XIII district is a nice place to stay honestly, You have access to the National Library and the cinema next to the river and nice places to walk and wander.\nPlaces to eat, easy access to transportation\u2026\n\nAs for tipping, it\u2019s absolutely because you were a visitor : no one asks for tipping when giving you your receipt at any kind of restaurant. They saw easy money. Sorry about that. And I never heard of Pink Mamma, there are many places hyped up that really don\u2019t live up to expectations. \n\nYou can definitely visit Paris in a week but like all big cities, they are always things like museums that you can access because of schedule not lining with tickets availability, weather, things getting close for renovations\u2026 Knowing transportation lines and shortcuts by heart helps.\nThen there is just living the city and not looking at your watch like a maniac and yeah it will take way more than a week for sure. \n\nGetting your schedule of activities set in advance is the best way to maximise your time.\n\nI hope you enjoyed your stay still!",
            "A classic place to eat which is an experience as well is Bouillon Chartier, with the Montmartre location being top tier. The queue seems long but moves really quickly, the service is amazing and fast without rushing you, the menu changes every day and all dishes and drinks are really inexpensive classic french brasserie choices while still being great quality and prepared in house. It\u2019s open from 11am till midnight and just a really cool place to go while not breaking the bank, but be warned if you are an odd numbered party you might end up sitting directly next to/opposite a stranger !",
            "Was just in Paris for a week and it was beautiful and amazing. \n\nI bought the navigo weekly for 35\u20ac and went to Disney for a day on RER A and it was included. \n\nVersailles kept getting bomb threats and my mom and sister went and got kicked out so it was kind of a wasted trip for them. \n\nDid not see a bed bug but checked seats and my hotel room. Every morning i also checked for blood spots In my sheets just in case i missed something. My Parisian friend said he's never seen them and takes the metro regularly despite having a car. However, he stopped going to cin\u00e9ma as a precaution. \n\nHave not heard of pink momma, but my sister wanted to go to Relais D'entrec\u00f4te and I thought it was overrated. Not terrible, but i ate better food. It was raining the night we went and we had to wait outside in line. They brought out umbrellas for the patrons which was very kind. \n\nOverall, many Parisians were very kind and spoke great English. I was kind of disappointed I didn't have more opportunity to practice my French. I definitely need the practice. \n\nWear comfortable shoes. As an American who has to drive nearly everywhere and is stuck at a work desk over 40 hours a week with no breaks, my feet were SORE. Hot showers and insoles helped. \n\nI would love to see stuff outside of paris, but one week wasn't enough to see all the major highlights imo. I spent 6 hours in the Louvre and saw the tiniest fraction. It got overwhelming at the end. \n\nMy Parisian friend said you get a better view of paris at Sacre Couer for free without waiting in line. Arc de Triomphe was amazing in person but Sacre Couer does have a beautiful view and was MUCH less crowded. \n\nI did love walking around the different neighborhoods. I stayed in monparnasse and loved it, but latin quarter, le marais, and montmartre are all very different. Montmartre is a climb uphill for sure. \ud83d\ude29 but worth it.",

The luggage racks at the end of the car were full and the overhead racks are too small to fit anything larger than a handbag. \n\nWe purchased expensive first class tickets and I'd been looking forward to a comfortable trip. Instead I sat for hours with my wheelie bag on my lap. Also the train was terribly airless and stuffy. \n\nI did see a flock of wild flamingos from the window, though.",

            "WoW about pink mamma I never knew they encouraged you to pay 15% tip.

            "5. The RATP fee scheme is so complicated it's ridiculous. Honestly even as a french parisian it feels like controllers are just taking advantage of this and scamming people. There should be a \"pay as you go\" option like in many big cities.\n\n7. The luggage situation in TGV is also ambiguous. There is no luggage limit (unless it's Ouigo) and people don't really try to save space when they put their luggage, it's just the next person's problem. I agree that SNCF people should force travelers to be more organized, cause if you are there is space for everyone's luggage most of the time.\n\nHope you still enjoyed your stay!",

            "For 5 and the RER. I still do not know how to pay for the RER tickets! lol.  Like you, on our trip to Versailles we got \u2018stuck\u2019 in a connecting station. We spoke to someone who helped us.   And just this week we actively searched the Navigo card app and the ticket machines at the gare the Lyon (RER A to RER B for CDG airport) to pay the RER B fare.   We couldn\u2019t find anyone to help and just decided to get on the train to CDG and figure it out there.   We spoke to a security agent at the gates and in my broken French we told him what happened and he told me to just go to the machines and buy a fare there.   If someone knows, please advise. I read we have to buy it from a ticket counter but the one I saw was not manned and only the machines were available.",

When I boarded, there was literally no space to put my luggage in, so I stood there at the luggage corridor. I waited there for about a couple of stations until people started boarding with their luggage.",

            "For 1 - It is absolutely not possible to see everything in Paris in 7 days. It is a big city and a lot of the experience is simply sitting in a cafe or a park, eating and just watching the world go by. I have been there over 2 dozen times, each time atleast 2 weeks and I still haven't seen 'everything', but then again I donot make checklists.\n\nFor 6- absolutely, explore rest of France. And this is true for any country.\n\nFor 7, Others have already mentioned there us extra place for luggage in  between  seats that are back-to-back, and you can store your not so big luggage under your seat.  And this is true for most regional/long distance trains, specially in first class. And there is usually seat to luggage ration to accommodate all travelers, unless some one has excessive luggage.\n\nIn general the metro in Paris is awful, the stations are dirty, esclators-if they exist- are often out of service, most metros don't have an AC(it is getting awful in summers)...and its amazing that they don't fix it, given the number of locals and tourists who need it everyday. From my past few visits I just avoided the metro and either walked or took cabs but thats neither eco friendly nor viable for everyone.",
            "Honestly most tiktok / ig famous restaurants in Paris are very overrated so I\u2019m not surprised pink mama wasn\u2019t a good experience. It\u2019s the type of place where you go to take photos and have overpriced / sub par food. \n\nIgnore trip advisor too, if you want to find a restaurant, use the fork :)",

            "Yes Pink Mama is totally over rated\u2026 Food was good but not worth the hype and the price. It felt like a total tourist trap and could have got much better food in the state which is the case in most Parisian restaurants these days\u2026",

            "Cool idea, Sentier is one of the last central neighborhood to undergo changes recently : historically a hub for Jewish wholesalers of clothes and jewelry, now this activity is mostly Chinese and located in the outskirts (Aubervilliers) and  some streets start to witness new bars or concept stores.  I do think even most Parisians living remotely from Sentier don't really know much about it for now, and nether do I, but I'm quite curious about this transformation.  Note that contrary to its Southern neighbor Montorgeuil which is all about trendiness everywhere, in Sentier you will still see lots of \"deprecated\" wholesale shops, but I think it's a matter of years for them to disappear completely.\n\n\\- One place with a lot of potential is le Passage du Caire, the oldest covered passage of Paris (built in 1798!), while not the prettiest,  which is now nearly a ghost passage as most of the stalls/ateliers are closed.  Waking through is still possible and interesting even though a bit strange. At both extremities\\* of the passage , there's two charming little squares (rue Saint-Spire, Google Image is outdated,and Place du Claire) where bars and hotels are popping in the last couple of years, still not frequented by the masses.\n\n\\- La Baignoire, a beautiful and intimate gastronomic restaurant that recently opened (not tried\n\n\\- for the love of food, a modern Morrocan-fusion restaurant (not tried)\n\n\\- la Esquinita , one of the very rare real Mexican delicatessen (if you are in absolute need of chili)\n\n\\- Brasserie Dubillot is one of the trendy \"old-fashioned but new\" spot\n\n\\- Clementine, if you want a real old-style popular brasserie.\n\n\\- If there is already one trendy street in Sentier it could be rue du Nil with the gastronomic franchise Frenchie (a restaurant, a bar and a wine shop) and some hip food shops.\n\n\\- The section of the long rue Saint Denis passing in Sentier was historically a place of  prostitution and still is to a much lesser degree, you may see a few -fairly older- prostitutes standing patiently at some of the doors of this section of this street only.\n\n\\- Aux Belles Poules, an old brothel, beautifully decorated, to visit with a guide but only in French I'm afraid [https://exploreparis.com/en/2253-the-belles-poules.html](https://exploreparis.com/en/2253-the-belles-poules.html)\n\n\\---\n\nJust east from Sentier\n\n\\- checkout the cute coffeshop Kafeibaie\n\n\\- the cultural center Ga\u00a8\u00eft\u00e9 Lyrique, and in particular  the Renaissance-style room on the 1st floor.

Don\u2019t just focus on the paintings, its archeological collections are also extremely interesting (e.g. the Hammurabi Code).

If you're Italian and under 26 a lot of museums are free btw\n\n2. Not really. Everything is worth it if you're interested \n\n3. Either that or the weekly pass (cheaper depending on when you're coming but less convenient), there's a whole section in the wiki of the sub\n\n4. It's not unsafe but not the most interesting area either, mostly old rich people live around there. I'd come back to Paris for drinks, more bars and people\n\n5. Browse the sub! Overpriced doesn't mean the same to everyone\n\n6. Sure it's reliable\n\n7. Expensive lunches and not very good, a boulangerie sandwich would be way better\n\n8. Don't let people tie a bracelet around your wrist, hand you a rose or sign a paper, all of these will be used as pressure to make you give them money. Don't buy metro tickets from anywhere other than the automated machine or the official booth in the metro station.\n\n9. I think we're over 10\u20ac a pack now.",
            ">Is The Fork reliable? I mean we have it in Italy also, but while looking at options in Paris I\u2019ve seen countless 9+ restaurants, some Michelin ones too, that offer a 50% discount even on Saturday for dinner, is that normal?\n\nIt's probably reliable, but the discounts are usually on select items only",
            "  \n2. None are really overrated, the only problem is that the most popular are overcrowded; I like the smaller Delacroix museum. \n\n5. There aren't many wineries around paris; there are nice wine bars like Frenchie or Willi's Wine Bar  (use the Raisin app to find them)\n\n6. I used TheFork for reservations before, it works, never tried discounts. (Italy or France); I also like LeFooding website for restaurant suggestions.\n\n8. send me some money, I'll tell you the scams to avoid, :-D",
            "I'm just gonna answer some of those cause I'm not sure about the rest \n\n2. I don't think there's really anything \"overrated\" in Paris, it just depends on what you want to see and experience. Don't just check boxes on a list. If you want to visit the Eiffel Tower, go visit it. If you just want to see it, go see it. If you want to visit the Louvre cause you love art and want to see it all, go visit the Louvre. BUT if you just wanna see the Mona Lisa because you think you must see it so you go there just to take a pic and leave, don't do it. It's a waste of time to go through everything just to say \"I saw it\" and you'll be disappointed (there's always huge crowds around it), enjoy your stay by doing things you want to experience like strolling in the streets of Montmarte, for example ! But that's a travel advice in general that is not specific to Paris. \n\n3. It's probably the best option if you don't stay between Monday to Sunday (there's a weekly pass but it always starts on Monday and always ends on Sunday, it was made for Parisians not tourists). You should check if you can put it on your phone cause Paris paper tickets are very flimsy and tend to demagnitise for nothing, don't keep them near your phone nor coins, nor any steel/iron. (Yes we know they suck, sorry). \n\n4. Parc des Princes is stuck between a wealthy neighborhood and a wealthy suburb, so it should be safe as long as you don't follow shady people in a dark alley. There's always people trying to scam tourists everywhere sadly, but it's a pretty safe area. \n\n7. As an ex-cast member : DO NOT EAT AT DISNEYLAND IT'S TERRIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. It's just industrial shit for twice the price of nice restaurants. Prepare a picnic. You're supposed to eat outside the parks though, but as long as you're discreet it should be fine. \n\n8. Do not let anyone give you anything. There are common scams like \"friendship bracelets\" they \"give\" you then charge you for it (they don't even ask, they just force it on you so just walk away fast if someone approaches your wrist) or they \"find\" a golden/diamond ring that you \"lost\", that kind of thing. Also fake petitions (then they ask for money to \"help\" or they take your stuff while you're signing). If you need a taxi, call Uber or go to the official taxi area at the airport/trains station, do not let any driver catch you, they're probably fake taxis. Real taxis just wait at the official area except if you booked them.\n\n9. Smoking is expensive in France, like 10-12\u20ac for a packet. Better to bring them from Italy (and bring me some please lol)",
            "The food is bad at Disney! So so so bad",
            "Just a comment on The Fork. It's fine, but most of the better restaurants aren't on it. And, as others have said, discounts are often quite limited. So if you're looking for Michelin level restaurants, you'll only find a few. And, in any case, I would only trust the highest rated restaurants...there are many mediocre choices where you'll get a good price but not a great meal.",
            "The medieval armor/WW1/2/etc. relics in the\u00a0[Mus\u00e9e de L'Arm\u00e9e](https://www.musee-armee.fr/en/english-version.html)\u00a0were awesome to see.\n\nI'd also recommend a visit (we spent \\~1hr at a Louvre pace/pretty rushed, so can occupy much more time) to the Cluny museum: original stained glass from Sainte-Chapelle, original King's heads from the Notre Dame. Part of the museum is in what used to be a Roman bathhouse.\n\nWe combined that with a quick visit to see the\u00a0[Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar%C3%A8nes_de_Lut%C3%A8ce)\u00a0where there was gladiatorial combat. The site later becoming a Roman cemetery,\u00a0[this](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co84770/plaster-cast-of-a-roman-childs-face-paris-france-1878-1920-plaster-cast)\u00a0plaster cast has been formed from the accidental immortalization of a Roman baby's face. Not much to see there but I can now say I stood where Roman gladiatorial combat was once held.\n\nWe went for new years. The only scammers we encountered were in the area around the Eiffel. Group of women, one shoving a clipboard in my face (don't let them get close or do this, as sometimes it's to block your view to pickpocket/take your watch or something, but sometimes they try to get you to sign then demand money after you sign). One asked, \"English?\" and a stern \"NO!\" and a disapproving wave of the hand had them scurrying. They'll go where the tourists go, we saw some potential pickpockets outside the Louvre too.\n\nGoing up the Eiffel was cool, and I'm glad to say that we did it, but when we went it was cold af and extremely windy, so we were only up at the top for long enough to buy champagne and have a toast. Going up the Arc at night was cooler imo, seeing the city lights. Be sure to time it so you're at the top at the start of a new hour to see the Eiffel sparkling. It took us about 30min to get up to the top from its base, the stairs were slow going as people needing a rest stopped everyone. There are a few cutouts where you can take a breather but they were full, it's like 300 steps up.\n\nIt seems like everyone smokes in Paris, like it felt like how it was here around Seattle in the 90's. I'd just be sure no customs issues with importation if you go that route but idk..I thankfully quit smoking.\n\nI'd suggest bringing a very strong umbrella.",
            "Definitely check if you are eligible for a free/discounted ticket. If you are from EU and under 26 most big museums offer free tickets, also Arc de Triuphe and a lot of churches.\n\nFor transport tickets: me and my girlfriend arrived sunday and bought a few normal tickets each and the navigo semaine card (because it only starts on monday) and it was cheaper than buying the weekly pass you mentioned. Just a thought maybe"

            "Unless you are really into museums and the weather is really bad, I suggest you don\u2019t do more than one of the big ones: Louvre, Orsay, Pompidou, etc. But if you are looking for hidden gems, try Musee Carnavalet about the history of Paris (it\u2019s free) Musee de la Chasse et de la nature (great \u2018cabinet de curiosit\u00e9 vibes), or Musee Cognac Jay. All are in the Marais and set in gorgeous XVIIth century palaces. Just spend an afternoon and an evening in the Marais, there are many art galleries, shops, trendy bars and restaurants and it\u2019s a very pleasant area for a walk.\nTake a walk from Jardin des Plantes to the Eiffel Tower, following the Seine. At Pont des arts, cross the river and enter the Louvre courtyard, then follow the Jardin des Tuileries until you reach Place de La Concorde. Then go back to the river banks, heading to the Eiffel Tower. It will be a long walk but you\u2019ll see most of the main spots along the way  (Notre Dame, \u00eele de la cit\u00e9, Louvre, grand palais, etc\u2026)\nYou can skip the Champs Elys\u00e9es.\nExplore the Latin Quarter, the Luxembourg garden and Saint Germain des pr\u00e8s area.\nLet me know what you like and I\u2019ll be able to give you more recs!",
            "Favorite hidden gem would be the 20th arrondissement. Mainly the \u201ccimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise\u201d. Don\u2019t be afraid its not gloomy, it\u2019s an historical cemetery and a total blast to have a walk in. Not far from there there\u2019s the \u201cparc de Belleville\u201d on top of witch you have a phenomenal view of all paris. Also not far you have the \u201ccanal st Martin\u201d super cool canal to have a walk with lots of nice bars to have a drink or eat a bit along the way. Even some hipster shopping. Then you can finish with the \u201cparc des Buttes Chaumont\u201d also a lovely romantic parc with terrific views and landscape. \n\nFinal advice : don\u2019t try to run and see everything : get lost a bit, go in the caf\u00e9 and have a drink, go in less touristy places. Don\u2019t queue for museum you have those at home and you don\u2019t even go there. Go see the city and not a random Van Gogh.",
            "You can't aim at seeing most of Paris in 4 days and also see hidden gems...  You have to make choices, and in the end there is absolutely no need to see MOST of Paris, just try to find places and activities that you can relate to and you'll be happy with your journey.\n\nYou said you have browsed through some guides : have you seen what usually US tourist calls their \"X days itinerary\" posted in this subreddit ?  If that's your thing ,there are a lot, and usually they stick pretty much to the same activities :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/search/?q=itinerary&restrict\\_sr=1&sr\\_nsfw=](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/search/?q=itinerary&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=)\n\nnon-touristic ideas here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/qgy58r/insights\\_for\\_enjoying\\_paris/](https://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/qgy58r/insights_for_enjoying_paris/)",

            "I know you said you've been there before so maybe for the kids' benefit, but we found it good to ride the wheel at the Tuileries early on in the trip, to better see the shape of the city we were soon to explore.\n\nEspecially as it'll be so close to you,  I'd recommend a visit (we spent \\~1hr) to the Cluny museum: original stained glass from Sainte-Chapelle, original King's heads from the Notre Dame. Part of the museum is in what used to be a Roman bathhouse.    \nWe combined that with a quick visit to see the [Ar\u00e8nes de Lut\u00e8ce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar%C3%A8nes_de_Lut%C3%A8ce) where there was gladiatorial combat. The site later becoming a Roman cemetery, [this](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co84770/plaster-cast-of-a-roman-childs-face-paris-france-1878-1920-plaster-cast) plaster cast has been formed from the accidental immortalization of a Roman baby's face. Not much to see there but I can now say I stood where Roman gladiatorial combat was once held.  \n\nWe checked out Shakespeare & Co from the outside, as the line was crazy.\n\nI think going up the Arc at night is best, timing it so you're up there at the start of a new hour.\n\nKeep in mind dancers are apparently topless for the Rouge. We were considering going, but being with extended family, seeing a topless show with them was not desired.   \n\nAlso, note that the main part of the opera house is/will be closed for rennovation for some time, apparently through the end of 2024. It was still cool to see what we could, though.",

Pere Lachaise is a little ride from Montmartre and takes a while to get around.\n\nGO to Montparnasse Cemetery (Sartre, Baudelaire, Man Ray, Seberg,  Beckett) if you can on Day 5. Easily achievable and less of a trek around than Pere L. as less cobbled climbs.\n\nGo to Abbey Books, too.",

Some ideas:\n\nSince Notre Dame is closed, consider the Virtual Notre Dame https://www.eternellenotredame.com/en/experience.  Fun way to learn the history while being blown away by the VR experience.  \n\nConsider downloading some of the Rick Steves walking tours - the P\u00e8re-Lachaise was a good way to visit some of the famous tombs (incl. Jim Morrison, of course) with explanations of who is famous for what, and Historic Paris goes all over central Paris, Left Bank including Shakespeare and Co, and \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9.  Easiest if everyone downloads and brings their own headsets.\n\nIt's been a while since I went to the Louvre but I think you may want to book your tickets so you don't have to wait in line."

            "Soooo... I rarely get to recommend this. We have a shop without money. It's like a charity shop, but everything is free. It's definitely a strange experience to just put stuff in your back pack and leave. It is the least curated thrift shop I've been to in Paris, but I have found a pair of basically brand new jeans. It's also quite small and a little away from the tourist Paris, but since you were asking... It's called Siga Siga.\u00a0 (I just checked Google. It seems it is no longer completely free. :( )\n\n\n\u00a0Next a step up on the ladder would be shops called Recyclerie. These are non profit thrift shops all around the city, so quite affordable etc. (They sell a wide range of products.)\n\n\n\u00a0The next one is I think for profit, but their prices go down each day and on Thursdays each item (they basically have just clothes) is only 0,95 \u20ac. They're called Sales voleurs (Dirty thieves). They have at least two shops in Paris now.\u00a0",

            "Looks good to me! I like that you're planning your days around the areas. What month are you visiting? ETA oh you're going in the Spring!!! Amazing!!!\n\nFor Day 2, don't miss visiting the Panth\u00e9on. Lots of famous people buried in the crypt like Pierre & Marie Curie, Voltaire, and Victor Hugo. I recently did a flashlight tour of the crypt in the dark at night! Super fun.\n\nFor Day 5, no there's not much around the Arc, just an expensive residential area full of embassies really. Def go up the Arc though and DO NOT cross the intersection to get to it!!! There's a TUNNEL to cross underneath and get tickets to go up though it's best to just buy online prior. You could visit the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent, it's a bit off the beaten path and I enjoyed it when my friend was visiting me in Paris! I had never been before.\n\nFor Day 6 I'd go to the Opera Garnier! It's my favorite place. Well worth a visit of the inside, it's what inspired the novel Phantom of the Opera. You can then go to the Galleries Lafayette department store behind it where there's a free rooftop terrace.\n\nFor Day 8, I've never been to Strasbourg but I promise the train won't feel so long. You could also go to Lyon which is only 2 hours away. I've been there twice, once with my bf during a train layover where we have about 2 hours of free time and we basically did a speedrun of the town lol. You can walk through the Vieux Lyon and its secret passages called *traboules* and go up the hill to the Fourvi\u00e8re basilica. There's a great view of the city from there. You can also check out *Lugdunum* which are the roman ruins of two huge amphitheaters!!! It's just a park you can wander into.\n\nYou'll find on Day 9 you'll enjoy getting lost in the Marais. Def go to Place des Vosges and have lunch at Jaja (affordable daily menu, seasonal fresh french food). The Archives and the Carnavalet museum are free. Lots of cute shops, caf\u00e9s and thrift stores around this area esp near the Centre Pompidou which is the modern art museum (you'll see why as you walk near it lol). **Check out the Tour Saint Jacques**. It's my favorite hidden gem. It's a tower in the middle of Ch\u00e2telet and you can climb up to the top on a guided tour and have THE BEST view of Paris. Thank me later lol\n\nIf you ever need to rest over a latte, my fave coffee shops are a chain called Noir, each one has beautiful interior design. It's your typical expensive coffee shop but it's cozy and yummy and they've got several locations around Paris.\n\nENJOY!!",
            "You'll love the Marais walking day.  I've lived in this area for the past three years now and there's just so much to see and feel here.  For a meal, I would highly recommend sitting outside at the restaurant \"Les Philosophes\".  It's a good mix of locals but also has tourists so you won't feel out of place.  It has good French food and lovely staff.  Just be aware that it's closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Actually, a lot of museums and attractions in the Marais are closed on Mondays (so check days and hours of things).  But most things in the Marais are open on Sundays (unlike other parts of Paris).\n\nAnother possibility for you is to check Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, not far from Place des Vosges.  They have a beautiful grand courtyard area where you can sit and get something to eat or a coffee.  Again this is closed on Monday. \n\nIf it's a weekend and the weather is nice, I also recommend going for an evening stroll along the Seine.  When it's warmer and nice out, you'll get such a good feel for French life on this walk.  It's a local past time to come out to the Seine in this area and sit on the edge of the river.  I'd recommend doing a stroll between Pont Marie (right by metro Saint. Paul) --> Pont Neuf.",
            "I recommend a day around Sacre Coeur and Butte Montmartre. Or half a day. You can walk up north from les Halles. In the middle there will be a bit of real untoruisty Paris but nothing dangerous. \nThe streets around Lea Halles are amazing, there are multiple beautiful churches. But  streets and markets are the deal. Walk up sacre coeur for the church and the view, continue downhill go montmartre, get lost in the small streets. Check the streets Ordener for example. Take the metro back at Jules Joffrin. \n\nView points, awesome restaurants with typical good French Food. I recommend le Coin des Amis rue Mont Cenis for a hidden gem. Restaurant is not cute or anything. But owner is cool and food authentic. \n\nI love walking around paris and I lived there 7y, moving back there in Feb. If you can check March\u00e9s de Paris time around where you go and make sure to wander in one of those. French farmers market are impressive.\n\nSome people are going to comment about a ton of scam at Sacre Coeur. Yes. Ignore everyone there. No eye contact   , headset/earbud on. No bracelet in your hands, no signing for disable people and no one except tourists to take a picture of you. It s easy. \"Not interrsted\" repeated over and over. No ticket outside of official booth too. That goes with everything in paris. Get a Navigo card with daily tickets on your first day. Dont take out your phone in the metro station and close your bags. Paris is safe, except for clumsy, ignorant and stupid people."

My friend and i also visited Lauderee and Angelina's while in NY so I could get a taste of Paris.  Also, like Paris, many of the people you encounter in Manhatten are tourists from other countries. I am so ready for this. So here I am, counting down the final days.  \n\nMy trip is balanced it with both tours and free time.  But now I'm also making notes of some of your suggestions.

There are fewer people (about 60% of the locals, and 20% of the usual population is \"replaced\" by tourists) and we are more relaxed, even those who work because everybody tends to be in vacation spirit. The only issue in the summer, especially this summer, is all the maintenance on the RER lines.",

            "I have nothing all that off-the-beaten-path to contribute, but here are some of my musts that I recommend (that you're probably already planning on and that have been mentioned here but I'll repeat them for emphasis:\n\n- Sacre Coeur: best view of the city imo, I love climbing to the top but even out front you get a gorgeous view of everything\n\n- Musee de L'Orangerie: I'm often surprised how many people I talk to missed this one. The Louvre's awesome and Mona Lisa's a transcendent experience and all that, but to me L'Orangerie is an essential addition. Right by the Louvre, they've got big Monet Water Lilies I'm sure you've seen in pictures before.\n\n- Musee D'Orsay: My favorite museum, not just because consistently the artwork is some of the best of its kind (lots of Impressionism etc.) but because I love the giant train station building. It's popular but there's something more relaxed about it compared to the Louvre.\n\n- Pere Lachaise Cemetary: I resisted this on my first trip, made it on a later trip, kinda wished it was on my first because it feels like an oddly essential part of a trip to Paris. Beautiful, peaceful walk through history, and fun to see the more notable graves (i.e. Edith Piaf, Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison). The most romantic cemetary in the world is of course in Paris.\n\n- Jardin du Luxembourg: Not in the neighborhoods you listed but easy to get to, the best Paris park. Walk, look at little boats in the fountain, bring some cheese and bread from a nearby cheese shop/bakery and have the best picnic of your life. Just lounge and wander (which is the mode you should be in the whole trip).\n\n- L'Avant Comptoir: If you're looking for great food in the Luxembourg Park area, this is a place I love (originally learned of it from Anthony Bourdain) that always provides a really cool experience. While it's not unknown every time I go I end up chatting with some locals, getting recommended wines, tasting amazing meats and cheeses and whatnot. Just an awesome meal at a very Parisian standing bar.\n\n- L'As du Falafel: Delicious falafel spot in Le Marais (very well known, but I'd still recommend it and the line moves quick). One of my favorite lunches in Paris is grabbing a falafel wrap there then walking down and sitting beside the Seine with it. There's supposedly a better falafel joint nearby but I've always been afraid to try something different because this place has always been good enough.\n\nYou said you love walking around and getting lost, and you're going to the perfect place for that. Just relax and wander, and other than those big places you REALLY want to see don't stress about missing anything, because the best places you'll find will be the ones you find around some corner you didn't expect. Any of the more \"hidden gem\" type places that came to mind when I read your question were great because they were part of my personal experience, and I think it's best if you just discover those on your own. And make sure you take time to just sit outside at a cafe, sip some wine, and take it all in. You're gonna love it.",
            "Have you seen Sainte Chapelle yet? If not, I\u2019d recommend highly, try for when the sun is out. Have you visited any of the markets? They\u2019re one of my favourite things to do... Bastille and President Wilson are two of my faves, fun for just looking at the goodies on sale, picking up some treats, and mingling with parisians doing their everyday stuff. Mus\u00e9e jacquemart andr\u00e9 and I see you\u2019ve already been recommended the musee Marmottan. Flea markets? Porte de Vanves is fun on the weekend mornings, or check spam.fr to see where their market is on the weekend you\u2019re there.",
            "Parc Buttes-Chaumont if you want a more local, laid back park with beautiful views of Paris, plus a wonderful bar called Rosa bonheur. Bouillon Pigalle if want cheap delicious French food near the bottom of Montmartre hill. If you're interested in getting some perfume that isn't overpriced and is hand made in France, look for a Fragonard or Molinard. Higher end place is called Nose in the 2nd Arrondissement. Good jazz clubs to go to: riv 38, caveau huchette, and gare du jazz. Some really delicious nouveau seafood can be found at the cod house in the 5th. Mus\u00e9e de la vie romantique is quaint and beautiful, there's a tea salon that opens into the garden and feels enchanted is located in the 9th. Hope this helps!",

Bref, bonne chance!",
            "If you have no clue about what to do in Paris, the first step might be to buy a guide book for all the touristic stuff, then let us know if you have more specifics questions, according to your tastes, age, etc.",
            "So are you asking where to go to take \"instagramable\" pics?",
            "There\u2019s a super cute little nook in Saint Germain, a strip of restaurants (Procope is one of them) at night, the lighting is absolutely magical/Instagram-able. A must for your list!",
            "I would not stress too much about where you stay, everything is close to a metro stop. The metro system can involve a LOT of stairs, so when I went, my husband and I took a cab to and from the airport to avoid luggage issues, even though we packed light. It is a flat rate from cdg, and it is posted inside the cab. Otherwise we used the metro to get everywhere. \n\nParis is a city that photographs beautifully, so wherever you point your camera you are likely to end up with a great photo. I would recommend a river cruise early in the trip, you get to see lots of landmarks and that might help you determine where you would like to explore further."

            "As an American who's lived in Paris since 2017, I am so glad you had such a nice time ! \n\nFor the people...it really does seem like everyone chose Paris for their first \"post-pandemic\" vacations. I am not used to this amount of people anymore !\n\nFor the language, as long as you know \"bonjour\", \"s'il vous plait\", and \"merci\" you'll be perfectly fine. I think the whole \"the French are rude\" thing comes from people who just assume and start the conversation with only English. Even I get annoyed when I see people do that.",
            "Also an American family just back from a wonderful trip to France (and the UK). #2 was exactly our experience to the point where it made me laugh! We had lovely interactions throughout France and could not figure out why people found the French rude. They were all very kind as we struggled with our basic French phrases and bumbling attempts to communicate. Then, Air France entered the picture on the way home and I cannot politely describe our frustration at the situation. Overall, wonderful trip and amazing people but Air France, whew!",
            "Questions about Air France at CDG\u2026. I am aware that our carry ons will be weighed (we have experienced this in Europe before). In what way(s) we\u2019re they rude and / or unhelpful?  Just trying to prepare ourselves\u2026 we are flying from Nice to Paris after visiting the French Riviera for a week and flying home to Canada from Paris the next day. Any pointers to keep that smooth and stress free?",
            "Yup, it is certainly busy in Paris. We were from May 5-19th.  Go early on the museums best bet. Sorry to hear about your experience on AF, never have we had an issue, never had to weigh our carry on bags - only the bags we have checked (precovid we only did carry on, out of the habit of traveling we checked a bag this time and brought way too much in clothing!)  Yes, USA makes you get tested to come home from any foreign country.  I believe the last petition to appeal that was submitted on May 8th to Biden. Delta president said they were encouraged by the news they are hearing. However antigen test still is necessary.",
            "Glad you had a nice time! :)",
            "A hint for when you travel again. Air France isn\u2019t the only airline that weighs your carry on pieces, please check the limits and respect them. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t know how Americans can complain about Air France, US airlines are the worst I\u2019ve ever flown on.",
            "Was there May 17th - June 2nd, I booked with Delta so flew from Phoenix to Los Angeles with them then Air France from there to Charles de Gaulles. Didn't have any issues with baggages nor meals or TSA. I was just worried that they could be strikes like last year and make it a big mess but was able to go through the scheduled strikes to move along.\n\nThe flight was uneventful  beside some turbulences. Plane was packed and not a lot of people were masked. Got an antigen test before leaving but never was asked to provide it, I'm guessing you don't need one anymore now.\n\nBest is to avoid rush hours to use the transportation system and if you can just walk. Paris is small and easy to walk around. \n\nI'm sure all the issues come down to people who want to travel now before the next pandemic strikes, if any, and it got overwhelming for airlines. \n\nLast year,  for my flight in June, they asked 35 people to be bumped as they overbooked it.... that's a lot for a local flight.\n\nGlad you had a good time though. Paris is a great destination."

We selected we were foodies and had interest in local culture and architecture. Your volunteer will email you with a proposed stroll and you can accept or decline. These are NOT tour guides. Our volunteer took us around her neighborhood (the 8th, which is also where we stayed) and talked to us about the architecture, some local history, took us to a food market and we walked through a nice park. Our stroll was about 3 hours and including a coffee/pastry stop. This was a highlight of our trip. They\u2019re not allowed to receive payment so we made a donation to the Greeters organization and paid for her coffee/pastries.",

            "When I was there in Feb, I walked from my hotel near the Ecole Miltaire metro in the direction of the Arc de Triumph. I didn't quite get there, but had a great stroll down the Champ de Mars, to the Palais Galleria (stumbled on it) then found the Yves St. Laurent museum not too far away and got a ticket to visit that. Had some wonderful food at the Villa Sophia and then grabbed an Uber back to my hotel. It was about 3 hours and approximately 3 miles of wandering. It was the day I arrived so I was a little jet lagged lol.\n\nI did eventually make it to the Champs Elysees another day following a similar route. :) I have been before so I just wing it, but did find interesting streets and architecture along the way with Google maps in my ear. It is hard to get very lost.",

Didn\u2019t have any issues honestly and it took me about 15 minutes to go from entry line to in front of the Mona Lisa. Things didn\u2019t really get bad until around noon when all the massive tour groups started filing in. Still worth it especially for a first timer in the city. \n\nI was solo though, so I experienced inattentive waiters and slow service all over. At one point, I thought to myself, maybe they should start a tipping culture because this is ridiculous. I\u2019m sure being with a family helped (as do reservations come to find out). \n\nThe Eiffel experience was cool, but like you said, doubt I\u2019ll make it back up there unless I\u2019m with someone new to the city. Still, very efficient process when I went for the sunset climb. \n\nHappy to hear y\u2019all had a good time. I hope Disneyland lived up to everything your kids had expected. I\u2019m from the south so *Disneyworld* has always been one of those things that most kids automatically expect to do, so I hope Disneyland was just as special. \n\nIf you\u2019re like me, it\u2019s already time to book that return flight!"

Dress well with comfortable shoes, as you will do much walking. I can\u2019t recall seeing many baseball caps.  \nCamera should not be an issue. Try not to stop in the middle of the street to take photos and block others, as the sidewalks are quite narrow. And pedestrians do not have the right of way over cars/bikes/ or busses. They will run you over. \nMake sure and be the first to say hello to EVERYONE in shops or restaurants before expecting to be acknowledged. Don\u2019t tip (unless exceptional service).

The trains are generally safe, if gross and hot - beware of suspicious puddles. Assuming you\u2019ll land in CDG, do you know how you\u2019ll get into Paris? The RER train connects the airport to the city, and the RER system is a bit different.\n\nI travelled with someone who took his camera everywhere in Paris and he was fine, just use commons sense and never, ever leave it lying around in public, if it has a long enough strap wear it like a cross-body bag - this would apply to any other personal belongings you carry around too ofc.\n\nAs for clothes, I\u2019d recommend shorts and light/cool shirts. I went in June and they just happened to have a heatwave while I was there, so the subway was HAWTT and MUSTY. I personally wouldn\u2019t choose pants but that\u2019s me. I\u2019d advise breaking in the loafers as much as you can now or sticking to the sneakers - I wore new loafers my first day in Paris as well and they scraped the back of my foot terribly and I was limping around the city - def a mistake. You\u2019ll be fine in cute tennis shoes like Adidas all stars or converse or whatever - they were ubiquitous when I was there. I wouldn\u2019t say that baseball caps are as much of a thing in fr as they are in the us, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a big deal if you did wear one - it should be fine.",
            "Use Google maps for transportation. The bus system is soooo easy and often quicker than the metro. I\u2019ve been several times and I\u2019ve never been nervous about pick pocketing, but just be smart and aware. I wear a purse, so that could be why."
